# Template p5 project

I can see this particale as something that is entirely interactive. On click the particle will react to the specific areas of the screen it approaches, turning red in situations of danger and and exploding of pulsing to express that fear, maybe turning blue and wavy like water when it reaches an "ocean" and turning bright colors. This could mauybe evenm be restricetd to a maze so its as though the particle is physically exploring to it's surroundings and reacting to its journey.
