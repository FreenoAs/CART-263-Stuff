# Template p5 project

The theme I was assigned was curiosity and exploration and as such, the viewer is encouraged to expore the screen with the player particle that will change while moving across the screen. While exploring there are other particle systems that will reveal themselves really encouraging the idea of exploring the map with the tiny little particle you venture with.
