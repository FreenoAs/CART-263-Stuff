# Template p5 project


My original struggle with this project was trying to figure out just exactly what I wanted to say with the data I was trying to visualize. It took me far longer then I thought to come up with a concept but I simply had to look at the my phone for the answer. Ever day I play the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes in which new charcters are constantly added for the sole purpose of fan service. Whether it be women in bridal dresses, women in summer outfits and women in halloween outfits but thats when it struck me, This came panders far too much to its audience, constantly feeding the male fantasy as scuh I wanted to explore just how severe this situation gets. I therefore created my own table for the game (I couldn't particularly find any table that was up to date) and with that visualize the different gaps in representation from gender differences to more technical things that involve the games mechanics. My next struggle was figuring out what exactly to visualize, already struggling conceptually I chose to portray (with simple shapes) the differences in character representation but alongside that I thought it would be fun to do something interesting with the data I compile and generate characters just like the game through the Hero summoner. Overall  found this project to be conceptually difficult but I thought it was very fun to experiment with data tables and exploring how exactly we can manipulate them through code.
